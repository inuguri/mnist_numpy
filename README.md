# Recognize Hand Written digits (from MNIST databse) using Numpy

Implement an L-layered deep neural network and train it on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains scanned images of handwritten digits, along with their correct classification labels (between 0-9). MNIST's name comes from the fact that it is a modified subset of two data sets collected by NIST, the United States' National Institute of Standards and Technology.

This implementation is from scratch using Numpy. No libraries like Keras or Tensor Flow are used. This gives a good understanding of how neurons or perceptrons are created to form a neural network with feed forward and backpropogation methods. Gradient Descent is used in backpropogation to find optimal solution.
